    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Gulab Jamun are delicate, berry-sized delights that are a perfect blend of softness and sweetness. These golden, deep-fried balls are made from a rich dough of khoya (milk solids) and flour, which are gently fried until they reach a light, crispy exterior. Once soaked in aromatic sugar syrup infused with cardamom and rose water, they become irresistibly soft and spongy. The warm syrup absorbs into the balls, making each bite a melt-in-your-mouth experience. The balance of sweetness and subtle floral notes creates a truly indulgent treat, making Gulab Jamun a beloved dessert at festivals, family gatherings, and special occasions.

<ol>
    <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine the grated khoya, all-purpose flour, and baking powder. Mix well.</li>
    <li>Add a small amount of milk and gently knead the mixture into a soft, smooth dough. Be careful not to over-knead.</li>
    <li>Divide the dough into small portions and roll each portion into a smooth, crack-free ball. Set aside.</li>
    
    <li>In a saucepan, combine the sugar and water for the syrup. Bring it to a boil, then reduce the heat and let it simmer for 5-7 minutes, until slightly thickened.</li>
    <li>Add the cardamom powder, rose water, and saffron strands (if using) to the syrup, and stir. Keep the syrup warm on low heat.</li>
  
    <li>In a deep pan, heat the oil or ghee over medium heat. Ensure itâ€™s hot but not smoking.</li>
    <li>Carefully add the dough balls to the hot oil, frying them on low to medium heat. Stir gently and fry until golden brown on all sides.</li>
    
    <li>Remove the fried balls with a slotted spoon and immediately place them into the warm sugar syrup.</li>
